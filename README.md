# Local AI Agent with RAG and MCP

This project implements a local AI agent that utilizes Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance its capabilities. The agent is designed to work offline, ensuring data privacy and security while providing intelligent responses.

## Features

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Combines retrieval-based methods with generative AI for more accurate and context-aware responses.
- **Offline Functionality:** Operates locally without requiring internet access, ensuring data privacy.
- **Customizable Knowledge Base:** Easily integrate your own documents and data for personalized responses.
- **Lightweight and Efficient:** Optimized for local environments with minimal resource requirements.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LocalAIAgentWithRAG.git
    cd LocalAIAgentWithRAG
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Set up your knowledge base by adding documents to the `data/` directory.

## Usage

Run the AI agent locally:
```bash
python main.py
```

Interact with the agent through the provided interface or API.
